`LinVulnScan` is a Python-based lightweight Linux privilege escalation discovery tool inspired by [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS).  
It identifies common misconfigurations, insecure binaries, SUID issues, and then **automatically tests** privilege escalation vectors using a **non-root user** created during runtime.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Checks for:
  - SUID/SGID binaries
  - World-writable files and paths
  - sudo misconfigurations
  - Cron jobs and scripts
  - Kernel exploits (basic check)
- 🧪 Automatically creates a temp user to **test vulnerabilities**
- 🔁 Attempts to exploit verified escalation vectors (ethically)
- 📝 Generates a scan report

## 🧪 Usage

Once installed, run the scanner using the following commands:

```bash

## 📁 Sample Output

Here is a sample of what the output will look like when the scanner runs:

```bash
[+] SUID Binary Found: /usr/bin/sudo
[+] Exploitable with sudo misconfig
[+] Attempting privilege escalation as user: tempuser
[+] Escalation successful. User tempuser gained root access.
```

## 🛡️ Ethical Use

`LinVulnScan` is intended for **authorized security assessments**, **Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions**, and **lab testing** only.  
**Please do not use this tool on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
